Phylogenetic Tree Building, Bar Graph Plotting, Transversion and Transition Graph Plotting.

HIERtree.R contains the code I used in all the tree building and population assignment.
The code has the files commented out which were generated by GALAXY and contain the information about the specific tree (the general specifications of the tree to be built are in the name of the file). To use a specific file either of small data, which is dataset number 1 in the report, or big data (dataset number 2). The multi-FASTA file with 'small' data must be used with any tree file that was made out of small multi-FASTA. In a similar manner, the big multi-FASTA must be used with any tree file that was made from big multi-FASTA. Furtehrmore, the tree file that is to be used to generate a tree mus t be uncommented; for instance, if "small_gammai.tree" is needed to be built, line 38 #newick.file.name <- "small_gammai.tree" need to be uncommented together with line 11 fasta.file.name <- "small_single.fa".

The following codes bar.R and transversion.R are built in a similar manner. If data needs to be extracted from the 'small' file, then fasta.file.name <- "small_single.fa" has to be uncommented. On the contrary, if the 'big' file is to be analysed fasta.file.name <- "big_single.fa" has to be uncommented, and the #fasta.file.name <- "small_single.fa" has to remain commented.

In the file Parsimony and other supplementary trees the trees that were not used in the main part of the report could be found. The 'final_boostrap_...' trees were generated and built from 'small' data and is run under different bootstrap criteria. However, since these trees were not selected to have branch lengh considered, they all are Parsimony trees and turned out to be the same.

Example of 'small' tree boostrapped with autoMR.

There are also 'big' neighbour-joining trees that did not make it to the report as I deemed them to be irrelevant.
